# Resume Project Description - UNITEST

## Updated Description for Resume

**Title:** UniTest – AI-Powered Assessment & Learning Platform

**Description:** 
A comprehensive AI-powered assessment and learning platform that leverages Google Gemini AI to automatically generate customized academic questions (MCQs, subjective, coding) with adaptive difficulty based on Bloom's Taxonomy. Unique differentiators include: AI-powered code review with educational feedback, conversational AI tutor for real-time learning assistance, predictive performance analytics, behavioral-based cheating detection, spaced repetition for long-term retention, and personalized study plan generation. Features PDF document processing for automatic topic extraction, real-time multi-language code execution, AI-powered subjective answer evaluation, comprehensive exam integrity monitoring (fullscreen, tab-switch, screenshot detection), and dual user roles with advanced analytics. Built with modern responsive design, the platform enables instructors to create, preview, edit, and export question papers while providing students with intelligent learning paths and detailed performance insights. Includes LMS integration capabilities, offline mode support, and accessibility features for inclusive education.

**Tech Stack:** 
Python, Flask (Backend Framework), Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API (AI/ML), PostgreSQL/SQLite (Database), SQLAlchemy (ORM), Flask-Login (Authentication), Bootstrap 5.3 (Frontend Framework), JavaScript, HTML5/CSS3, PyPDF2 & NLTK (NLP/PDF Processing), ReportLab (PDF Generation), CodeMirror (Code Editor), Piston API (Code Execution), Vercel (Cloud Deployment), RESTful APIs
